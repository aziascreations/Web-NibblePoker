meta.title: CircuitPython - Custom File Systems
meta.description: "Set of examples of custom file systems and block-level devices for CircuitPython that can be
used for educational purposes and expanded upon."

intro.title: Introduction
intro.text.10: "The goal of this experiment was to try and give people a strong, clear, and documented starting point
  for future experiments that may require virtual file systems and block-level devices on CircuitPython devices."
intro.text.20: "For example, by using the blank examples, you can easily create a bootstrapping code and file system
  that connects securely to a remote server and pulls code directly from it without ever having to touch the MCU's
  flash storage."
intro.text.30: "The second main advantage is that this project can serve as a robust educational tool."
intro.text.31: "Due to the permissive nature of Python and CircuitPython's APIs, it lets people easily test out
  different designs and mechanisms for their file systems without running the risk of corrupting unrelated data or
  bricking their device."
intro.text.32: "Additionally, it is possible to manipulate and add logging to many of the methods which allows you to
  see and understand the inner workings of CircuitPython, filesystems and BLD devices themselves."
