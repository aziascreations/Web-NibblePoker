  title: Introduction

    p1:
      l1: My name is Herwin Bozet, I'm an experienced developer with extensive
        experience in PureBasic, Python, .NET, Java; and intermediate knowledge in C, Win32
        APIs, embedded systems and general web development.
    #  l2: I've been programming for about 10 years now, and for the last
    #    5 years I've been actively working on applying that experience to a variety of projects
    #    with the aim of helping programmers and people in their day-to-day life.
    #p2:
    #  l1: NibblePoker is, in essence, a simple moniker and the front-end
    #    for most of my public-focused work.
    #  l2: It houses all my work made and tailored for usage by other people.
    p3:
      l1: This entire website, as well as all my work for it and other
        personal projects, is completely open-source and available under permissive <abbr
        title="Open Source Initiative">OSI</abbr> approved licenses.
      l2: All of it is maintained, developed and expanded in my free time
        with the occasional help from people in the open-source community.

future:

    p1:
      l1: It is planned to turn NibblePoker into a <abbr title="Private
        company with limited liability">SPRL</abbr> in a couple years if everything goes
        as planned.
      l2: This would allow me to centralize many things and invest properly
        in my targeted fields to achieve my goals.
    p2:
      l1: The goal would be to create a small sustainable local business
        that offers a wide range of products and solutions covering <abbr title="Internet
        of things">IoT</abbr> devices, programming, and technological independence ; All
        while including the required software and hardware components often lacking in such
        products and solutions.
    p3:
      l1: Ultimately, all this work and research would be made available
        to the public under open-source licenses, enabling anyone who wishes to learn, reuse,
        and resell open-source products, to do so in a similar way as companies like Adafruit
        do.

    p1:
      l1: This website, as well as the surrounding infrastructure,
        was made to cost as little as possible while not being reliant on any censor-happy
        companies.
      l2: Following my core tenets, I also wanted to retain some sort
        of "technological sovereignty", and therefore refuse to support or use companies
        that actively fight against legal free speech.
    p2:
      l1: The details of the operating costs are provided below to
        illustrate the low price of such independence.
    p3:
      l1: And for those of you who are more motivated, I hope to inspire
        you to at least try this kind of activity.
      l2: It may seem daunting at first, but for a fraction of the
        cost presented here, <b>and with a bit of motivation</b>, you can already accomplish
        a lot of things and gain valuable knowledge for a world as interconnected as ours.
    isp: The main ISP bill isn't accounted for since this could run
      off some random public Wi-Fi.
