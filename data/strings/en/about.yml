header.title: About
intro.title: Introduction
intro.text.01: My name is Herwin Bozet, I'm an experienced developer with extensive
  experience in PureBasic, Python, Java, VBA; and intermediate knowledge in C, Win32
  APIs, embedded systems and general web development.
intro.text.02: I've been programming for about 10 years now, and for the last
  5 years I've been actively working on applying that experience to a variety of projects
  with the aim of helping programmers and people in their day-to-day life.
intro.text.10: NibblePoker is, in essence, a simple moniker and the front-end
  for most of my public-focused work.
intro.text.11: It houses all my work made and tailored for usage by other people.
intro.text.20: This entire website, as well as all my work for it and other
  personal projects, is completely open-source and available under permissive <abbr
  title="Open Source Initiative">OSI</abbr> approved licenses.
intro.text.21: All of it is maintained, developed and expanded in my free time
  with the occasional help from people in the open-source community.

future.title: Future plans
future.text.01: It is planned to turn NibblePoker into a <abbr title="Private
  company with limited liability">SPRL</abbr> in a couple years if everything goes
  as planned.
future.text.02: This would allow me to centralize many things and invest properly
  in my targetted fields to achieve my goals.
future.text.10: The goal would be to create a small sustainable local business
  that offers a wide range of products and solutions covering <abbr title="Internet
  of things">IoT</abbr> devices, programming, and technological independence ; All
  while including the required software and hardware components often lacking in such
  products and solutions.
future.text.20: Ultimately, all this work and research would be made available
  to the public under open-source licenses, enabling anyone who wishes to learn, reuse,
  and resell open-source products, to do so in a similar way as companies like Adafruit
  do.

financing.title: Financing
financing.text.01: This website, as well as the surrounding infrastructure,
  was made to cost as little as possible while not being reliant on any censor-happy
  companies.
financing.text.02: Following my core tenets, I also wanted to retain some sort
  of "technological sovereignty", and therefore refuse to support or use companies
  that actively fight against legal free speech.
financing.text.10: The details of the operating costs are provided below to
  illustrate the low price of such independence.
financing.text.20: And for those of you who are more motivated, I hope to inspire
  you to at least try this kind of activity.
financing.text.21: It may seem daunting at first, but for a fraction of the
  cost presented here, <b>and with a bit of motivation</b>, you can already accomplish
  a lot of things and gain valuable knowledge for a world as interconnected as ours.
financing.text.isp: The main ISP bill isn't accounted for since this could run
  off some random public Wi-Fi.
