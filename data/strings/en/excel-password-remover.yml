intro.title: Introduction
intro.p1: >-
  This project aims to simplify the removal of passwords on Excel's Worksheet by
  leaving the task of editing the XML files on an Excel document to your
  browser.
working.title: Security & Internal workings
working.p1: >-
  In terms of security, your browser handles all the data without sending any of
  it to a central server like many web apps do.<br>This makes it, and your data,
  as safe as your browser can be since it is the only potential point of failure
  here.
working.p2: >-
  As for the internal workings, the only thing this tool does is extract the
  content of the <code>.xlsx</code> file you gave it and removes the passwords
  on any worksheets and makes a new file with all the changes.<br>Once all of
  that is done, the file is downloaded via a <a

  URL</a>.

eula.1: "This tool should only be used with files you have the express permission to unlock."
eula.2: "All password removal is done locally in your browser, and <span class='t-bold'>no data is sent online</span>.<br>
The original password cannot be revealed as it’s secure by design and not stored in plain text; it simply gets removed."
eula.3: "By using this tool, you accept full responsibility, and that it is provided “as is” without any warranty."
