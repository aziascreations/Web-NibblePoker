intro.title: Introduction
intro.p1: A simple CLI tool that can list COM ports with their full name easily and
  cleanly.
intro.p2: This tool is intended to replace the tedious task of having to use the <code
  class="code">mode</code> command, and the <i>Device Manager</i> to find a newly
  plugged-in device that provides a COM port.
intro.p3: This version of the program is a complete refactoring of my old <a href="https://github.com/aziascreations/PB-ListComPort">PB-ListComPort</a>
  project that also changes from the proprietary and paid PureBasic language and compiler
  to .NET 6.0.
