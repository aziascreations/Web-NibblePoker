# Data collection
This websites only collects data through generic access logs in order to detect and block bad actors from accessing this website.
None of the data collected is used for any other purpose,it is never shared with any other third-party and is never use in any sort of analytics.

Here is the list of private data being collected:
* IP address forwarded to us by CloudFlare
* Browser's User-Agent

And here is the list of non-private data being collected:
* Requested resource' URI
* Date and time

Once the data has been logged in the access logs, it is automatically retrieved and processed by a locally-hosted application every 30 seconds and then deleted from said logs.

This application compares this information against a list of known threat sources, targets and behaviours and if a match is found, the private information is anonymized and stored for 7 days pending a manual review.
Once that 7 day period has elapsed, or once the report has been reviewed, all the relevant data is automatically deleted.

If your request wasn't flagged as potentially malicious, every data collected from it is thrown out instantly.

This process should normally never be triggered for regular traffic since most of the triggering actions are ones that should not be possible to accomplish through normal browsing.
However, this process isn't infallible and there is always an off chance that false positives may happen.
